# HTML Style Guide

_A guide to writing and maintaining good markup._

Probably, as [@davexunit](https://github.com/davexunit) says, we should stop writing all this by hand and make it programmatic.

<a name="keep-html-structure-as-simple-as-possible"></a>
### Keep HTML structure as simple as possible.


<a name="structure-markup-to-create-meaningful-hierarchical-relationships"></a>
### Structure markup to create meaningful hierarchical relationships.

Ideally, if you view your document with all styles turned off, a page should resemble a sensible outline. Among other things, this is a foundation for good accessibility.


<a name="stick-to-proper-semantics"></a>
### Stick to proper semantics.

* Don't use a `<div>` or `<span>` when a more meaningful element is available.
  * `<ul>` for lists
  * `<a>` for links
  * `<input type="button">` or `<button>` for buttons
  * etc.
* Never add a `<div>` or `<span>` with no attributes.


<a name="use-2-spaces-for-indentation"></a>
### Use 2 spaces for indentation.

Set your editor to use spaces, not tabs.


<a name="stick-to-a-line-length-of-100-characters"></a>
### Stick to a line length of 100 characters.

* Wrap lines that are overlong.
* Align attribute names for all lines after the first.
* Indent wrapped lines at least twice to distinguish them from nested elements and honor the previous item.
* One attribute per line when manually wrapping.
* For one-character element names, it's OK that the first attribute won't align with the rest.

<a name="lowercase-all-element-and-attribute-names"></a>
### Lowercase all element and attribute names.


<a name="use-a-slash-in-self-closing-tags"></a>
### Use a slash in self-closing tags.

For "empty" elements, use XHTML-style closing syntax: `<br />, <link rel="..." />`.


<a name="dont-omit-closing-tags"></a>
### Don't omit closing tags.

Although HTML5 allows omitting certain closing tags, like `</p>` and `</li>`, *DON'T*. It just makes your markup harder to comprehend.


<a name="order-of-elements-in-the-head"></a>
### Order of elements in the HEAD.

Keep `<head>` section in the following order:

1. `<meta>` elements
2. `<title>` element
3. Style sheet `<link>`s


<a name="give-your-document-a-useful-title"></a>
### Give your document a useful title.

<a name="include-all-stylesheet-links-in-the-head"></a>
### Include all stylesheet links in the HEAD.

They should start loading & rendering as soon as possible.


<a name="keep-content-presentation-and-behavior-separate"></a>
### Keep content, presentation, and behavior separate.

* No inline styles.
* No inline JavaScript or event handlers.


<a name="use-aria-roles-and-labels-when-appropriate"></a>
### Use ARIA roles and labels when appropriate.

If you must use a non-semantic element, add an [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/ "Accessible Rich Internet Applications") role to give hints to user agents/assistive technology. [Link to ARIA Roles]

```html
  For an element that has click behavior attached, but isn't a sensible
  clickable element (not that you're EVER going to do this): 

  Bad: no semantics
  <span class="buttony">
    Grok
  </span>
  
  Good: Semantics via ARIA role
  <span class="buttony" role="button">
    Grok
  </span>

  Better: Use the right element in the first place
  <button class="buttony">
    Grok
  </button>
```


<a name="use-html5-input-types-when-applicable"></a>
### Use HTML5 input types when applicable 

E.g., `url`, `email`, etc.

[Full list of HTML5 input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-type)

Doing this communicates semantics to user agents and assistive tech. For example, using `type="numeric"` might trigger the appropriate keyboard state on mobile.

<a name="links-buttons--anchors"></a>
### Links, Buttons & Anchors
#### Links
```
<a href="www.google.com">Search Google</a>
```

Use this style of anchor tag to create links to other pages.

If using a link anchor tag as a placeholder (`<a href="#">Not a real link</a>`), then be sure to add `ev.preventDefault()` to your JS click event heandler. Alternatively, use `href="#0"` to prevent the default link action. `#0` works because ids cannot start with a number. Otherwise, the page will jump to the top every time a user clicks your placeholder.

Note: This is *NOT* the same thing as `<link rel="">`.

#### Buttons
```
<button type="submit">Text</button>
<button type="button">Text</button>

<input type="submit">Text</input>
<input type="button>Text</input>
```

A `button` is by default a *submit* button, and will trigger the action of a form if it's inside one. Add `type="button"` to make it a non-submit button.

The advantage of `<button>` is that you can put other elements inside it, whereas you can only use plain text labels for `<input>`-style buttons.

#### Anchors
```
<a name="#some-text">Text</a>
```

Anchors are great for jumping to information farther down a page. 

#### Buttons vs.Links vs. Anchors
##### The semantic question of link vs button:
|  | **Buttons** | **Links** | **Anchors** |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Action** | A button invokes an action: Save, Cancel, Exterminate. | A link takes you somewhere (navigates). | No action; Identifies a page fragment that can be the destination of a link. |
| **Activation key** | Activated with the Space or Enter key. | Activated with the Enter key. | No. |
| **Screen readers** | Identified in screen readers as a button, and included in the list of form controls. | Identified in screen readers as a link, and included in the list of page links. | Screen reader reads this like a regular text. |
| **Focusable by default?** | Yes. | Varies (user Pref). | No. |

##### Considerations when choosing an element:
 * `<input>` elements belong inside a `<form>`.

##### There _are_ ambiguous cases:
* One common pattern is to present the primary action as a button and the secondary action as a link (e.g., Save button and Cancel link). 
* If the button/link is meant to reveal hidden information, such as an info modal, use `<a href="#0">Show Me Stuff!</a>`.

As with everything, it's not simply a matter of style -- the semantics are important, and have real consequences for keyboard and screen reader users.
